Environmental Requirements

     Our system considers the chance that professors may want to deliver statements regarding internal affairs to the manager of the company to provide information regarding the conduct of the lesson that may be beneficial to the manager of the firm to predict future business development strategies. However, the scope of information that will be shared will be limited, taking here into account the consent of the students with regard to the privacy terms as well as their prior notification. The teachers will also be able to comment on students performance and in some limited cases (such as tests held in the end of captures or the final test just before the end of the course), the teaching staff will also be able to grade the students performance based on the grading system in Albania. The students will have the opportunity to communicate with their professors through our application, but in cases of not being able to attend classes, the former contract underwritten by both parties before the course registration will determine if any substitute will follow. Since the manager of this system will have access to certain students data, it is important to underline that he/she can not share the data of students with their classmates or other students part of this center. This rule derives from the privacy terms that will be part of the contract signed before the payment fee of the chosen course. All the users of the three categories will be able to upload files in their profiles and the system will grant the limitation of visibility of these files due to the fact that the content may be confidential or because of a certain demand of a system user.
