## Description
Our aim is to design an application that will assist the daily needs and service of a small company operating in Tirana, Albania. This will be a firm offering courses of several foreign languages to students of different ages and we will construct a platform in order to assist them in their daily operations. Firstly, we will talk to the professional staff in order to identify their needs, but in general, our app will enable the professors to record their working hours, calculate their salary based on the workload and overtime working hours, release statements to students and to the manager if they can not come to the class, post teaching materials and comments regarding the conduct of the lesson, etc. Regarding the students, they will be able to have access to the teaching materials delivered by their teacher/s, ask questions to the professor or write to the class group if they want to collaborate in a certain project together with other classmates. Another functionality we will add is being able to check the schedule of the class and getting a notification If the class is canceled or postponed. The manager of this facility will keep track of the work load of the staff, will organize the schedule of the classes (which includes  determining the date and time as well as the class where the class will be conducted). The manager will also be able to release statements to the teachers if the classes will not be held for reasons such as: national holidays, bad weather conditions, etc. This category of user will also have the option to interact with the staff, taking here into account several circumstances such as: leaves, contract renovations, lesson substitution, etc. The manager will receive updates regarding the performance of the classes as well as the number of students and general information regarding their background such as : age, gender, level of language, courses chosen, etc.
