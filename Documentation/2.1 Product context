This app will allow students to be informed and communicate freely with the teachers. 
Every student registered in a certain program has access to the schedule, the program,
the task assigned by the teacher, etc. On the other hand, every teacher will record the
students' absences during the lessons, he will adjust the schedules, enter the hours he 
has worked into the system, and he will be in charge of changing the schedule according 
to the agreement with the students. Every unregistered student will be able to be informed 
about programs and tactics, prices , schedules and contact methods. On the other hand, the
manager of the center will be able to control the activities of the teachers on a daily
basis, as well as deal with the calculations of working hours as well as the maintenance 
of the center.
